# IAT 355 / A2 Personal Website

## Purpose of the Website

This website was conceived to be a first draft for a possible future portfolio that would assist job search and personal online representation, but its most immediate purpose is to store visualizations completed for IAT 355 Introduction to Visual Analytics course.

## Technologies Used

The website is written in pure HTML5/CSS3 with a bit of vanilla JavaScript to allow for dynamic web page loading. It permits the navigation bar to stay and change _only_ the content as you navigate (inspired by popular web frameworks such as ReactJS).
